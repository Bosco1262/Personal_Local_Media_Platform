[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

Personal Local Media Platform is a lightweight local media management tool for organizing and playing videos, audios, and images. It features intuitive filtering, tag-based organization, and a responsive interface for a personalized media experience.

## Overview

Personal Local Media Platform is a comprehensive solution for managing your local media collection. Unlike cloud-based services, all your photos, videos, and audio files remain stored on your own device, ensuring complete privacy and control.

This platform combines a user-friendly frontend interface with a robust backend system to deliver a seamless media management experience tailored to individual users.

## Features

- **Unified Media Library**: Organize videos, audios, and images in one centralized location.
- **Tag-based Organization**: Categorize media with custom tags for easy retrieval.
- **Intuitive Filtering**: Quickly find content by type, date, tags, or custom criteria.
- **Responsive Interface**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Local Playback**: Built-in media player optimized for various formats.
- **Metadata Management**: Automatically extract and edit media metadata.
- **Privacy-focused**: All your data and media files remain on your local device.
- **Custom Collections**: Create personalized albums and playlists.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: A responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.
- **Backend**: A lightweight Node.js server using Express.js for handling media processing and data management.
- **Database**: A local database for storing metadata and user preferences.
- **File Handling**: Direct access to the local file system with user permission.
